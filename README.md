# Background
This is a model testing project that takes as input data from the SEER database. This data is used to predict
survivability outcomes of breast cancer patients. 

## Instructions
First install the requirements into a Python 3.12 environment.
There are three distinct scripts that should then be run in order:

* preprocessing.py
* feature_selection.py
* modeling.py

The preprocessing script will perform data preprocessing on the given SEER dataset.

Feature selection will output the top 5 features to be used.

Finally, the modeling script will test a series of models (mostly using scikit-learn) against the dataset to predict
survivability outcomes.
